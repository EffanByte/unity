# How to contribute

## Local setup
Setting up the project locally is similar to any other unity project:
- Make sure you have [Unity `2022.3.23f1`](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.23)
- Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. 
- Fork the repository and clone it.
- Now to build the plugin you can run the following commands in a terminal your choice:
```shell
cd Assets/Playroomkit
npm install
```
- The above commands should generate a `plugins`folder with a `JSLIB` and a `JSPRE`file.  
- Your setup is now complete. you'll need to run `npm install` when `Playroomkit/src/index.js` is changed / updated.
