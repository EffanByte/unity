### PlayroomKit SDK for Unity

This SDK is a wrapper over PlayroomKit JS. Currently, it runs PlayroomKit JS in WebGL, and interfaces the functions into wrapper functions in C#.

The objective is to keep the API as similar to the JS version as possible. Thanks to abstractions, it'll soon be possible to recreate the entire library in C#.

But only if we face performance issues. :D
